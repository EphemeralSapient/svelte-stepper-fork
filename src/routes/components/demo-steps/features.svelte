  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>
    Svelte Stepper comes with a lot of built-in functionality, while still remaining easy-to-use at
    its core.
  </p>

  <h4>Simple & safe</h4>
  <p>
    Svelte Stepper is written entirely in TypeScript, and all its interfaces are fully type-safe out
    of the box. To get started, all you need to do is provide a sequence of Svelte components as
    steps. Every step can receive custom props.
  </p>

  <h4>Animations</h4>
  <p>
    Did you see that step transition when you clicked "Next" just now? Svelte Stepper automatically
    transitions steps in a delightful way, and even smoothly adjusts its height to match each new
    step component. Of course, you can fully customize all animation parameters.
  </p>

  <h4>Context & multi-step forms</h4>
  <p>
    Svelte Stepper includes a full context API, which allows you to share data between steps. This
    enables advanced usecases like building up form data over several steps, and submitting it at
    the end.

  <svelte:fragment slot="actions">
    <Button variant="ghost" on:click={controller.previousStep}>Go back</Button>
    <Button variant="primary" on:click={controller.nextStep}>Next step</Button>
  </svelte:fragment>
</StepLayout>
